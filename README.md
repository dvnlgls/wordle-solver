# Wordle Solver

> For a while I have been using a js script to help me solve wordle problems. As much as I'd love to solve puzzles without assistance, my patience has an upper limit. I thought, why not build a front end to make my life a bit easier? Voila, this wordle solver was born. Conceived as a fun weekend project, I'm hoping to improve it with time. Contributions welcome.
